## Problem Definition:

The task at hand involves developing a software solution to simplify the creation and modification of custom-built computer systems with various specifications. The objective is to enable efficient management of computer configurations while maintaining flexibility during both the initial assembly and subsequent updates.

### Requirements:

**Builder Pattern Implementation:** The solution should utilize the Builder Pattern to construct and modify Computer objects. This pattern enables the creation of Computer instances with specific hardware and software configurations.

**Director Class:** A Director class should be provided to streamline the creation of Computer objects. This Director class should also offer methods for updating individual components and software packages of the Computer objects.

**ComputerBuilder Class:** A ComputerBuilder class should be created to manage the construction and configuration of Computer objects. It should offer a fluent and adaptable approach to specifying the hardware components, peripherals, and software packages of the Computer.

**Visualization of Changes:** The solution should output the resulting Computer instances to the console, allowing users to visualize the changes made to the computer configurations. This includes displaying details of the CPU, RAM, storage, graphics card, and installed software.

### Constraints:

1. The solution must correctly implement the Builder Pattern, ensuring that Computer objects are constructed efficiently.
2. The Director class should effectively guide the assembly of Computer objects and allow for updates to individual hardware components and software packages.
3. The ComputerBuilder class should be designed to offer flexibility and a fluent interface for configuring various aspects of the Computer.
4. The code should be capable of generating and displaying Computer objects with a wide range of hardware and software specifications.
5. The solution must be maintainable and scalable to accommodate potential future changes or additions to computer components and software packages.
