# Iterator Design Pattern

- The Iterator pattern provides you with a uniform way to access different collections of an object.
- If you get an array, arraylist and hashmap of an objects you can pop out iterator for each of them and treat them all as the same.
- It provides an unique way to cycle through different collections.
