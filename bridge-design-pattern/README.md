## Builder Design Pattern

- It divides and oraganizes single class that has multiple varients of some functionality into two hirarchies:
1. Abstractions
2. Implementations

- It independantly introduces new abstractions and implementations making in very easy to switch b/w them at run time.

- This way client code won't be exposed to the implementation details.
