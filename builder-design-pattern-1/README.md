## Problem Definition:

The problem at hand is to develop a software solution that streamlines the creation and modification of mobile phone objects with various attributes. The goal is to enable the efficient management of mobile phone configurations while maintaining flexibility during both initial creation and subsequent updates.

### Requirements:

- Builder Pattern Implementation: The solution should employ the Builder Pattern to create and modify Phone objects. This pattern allows for the construction of Phone instances with specific attributes.

- Director Class: A Director class should be provided to facilitate the creation of Phone objects. This Director class should also offer methods for updating individual attributes of the Phone objects.

- PhoneBuilder Class: A PhoneBuilder class should be created to handle the construction and configuration of Phone objects. It should provide a fluent and flexible approach to specifying the attributes of the Phone.

- Visualization of Changes: The solution should output the resulting Phone instances to the console to allow users to visualize the changes made to the phone configurations.

### Constraints:

The solution should ensure that the Builder Pattern is correctly implemented.
The Director class should effectively guide the construction of Phone objects and allow attribute updates.
The PhoneBuilder class should be designed for flexibility and fluent configuration.
The code should be capable of producing and displaying Phone objects with various attributes.
The solution should be maintainable and scalable for potential future enhancements or changes in mobile phone attributes.
